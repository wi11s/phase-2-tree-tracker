# Tree Tracker!
## DEMO: https://youtu.be/YeJEppboJRg

A new way to explore your city! Easily identify trees and keep track of your progress. 

We used google maps API and a plant identification API. You can add a tree to your map and tracking history by typing the name of tree or simply uploading a photo. By doing so, the name of the tree, infomation about the tree, and a photo will automatically be mapped and added to your tracking progress. 

Our stunning UI is easy to use and completely original, no design frameworks or library were used other than Framer Motion.
